## `Overview`

This project applies sentiment analysis to a large amount of tweets to determine the appeal of Fast Food chains in the United States.

**The Goal:**
* Better understand fast food chainsâ€™ brand appeal in the United States. 
* Twitter has over 300 million monthly active users as of 2019
* Many post about their opinions on a variety of different topics, so there is a vast amount of data related to fast food.

**The Benefit:**
* By using sentiment analysis to determine if a tweet is positive or negative, along with geolocation data, we can visualize the public appeal of fast food chains in different areas of the United States.
